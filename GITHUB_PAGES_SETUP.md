# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ React app built successfully
- ✅ gh-pages branch created and deployed
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Latest commit pushed to trigger deployment

## GitHub Actions Deployment
The repository now has a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically:
1. Builds the React app when you push to main branch
2. Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
3. Uses the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action for deployment

## Manual GitHub Pages Configuration (if needed)

If the site still shows the README instead of your React app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access Repository Settings
1. Go to https://github.com/SreeCharanManne/Portfolio
2. Click on the "Settings" tab (you need to be signed in as the repository owner)

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click "Pages"
2. Under "Source", you should see "Deploy from a branch"
3. If it shows "Deploy from a branch":
   - Branch: Select "gh-pages" (not "main")
   - Folder: Select "/ (root)"
4. If it shows "GitHub Actions" as the source, that's perfect - leave it as is
5. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages deployments can take 5-10 minutes to propagate
- Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the deployment status
- Once complete, visit https://sreecharanmanne.github.io/Portfolio/

## Troubleshooting

### If the site still shows README:
1. Check the "Actions" tab for any failed workflows
2. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
3. Verify the Pages settings are configured correctly
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

### If GitHub Actions fails:
1. Check that all React dependencies are properly installed
2. Ensure the build process completes without errors
3. Verify the workflow has proper permissions

## Alternative Manual Deployment
If GitHub Actions doesn't work, you can still use the manual gh-pages deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build and deploy directly to the gh-pages branch.

## Current Configuration
- **Homepage URL**: https://sreecharanmanne.github.io/Portfolio
- **Build Directory**: ./build
- **Deployment Branch**: gh-pages (created automatically)
- **Deployment Method**: GitHub Actions (automatic on push to main)
